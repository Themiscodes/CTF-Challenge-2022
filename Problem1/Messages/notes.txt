entry #79:

so i recently found this software called gpg which is capable of encrypting my
files, and i came up with a very smart and easy-to-remember way to finally keep
my data secret:

First of all, I generate a random passphrase using the SHA256 hash algorithm,
and then I save it on disk in hex as "passphrase.key". In particular, here is
how to generate the key:

    key = SHA256(<current date in RFC3339 format> + " " + <secret string>)

    e.g. so if the secret string is "cement" then the key would be:
             key = SHA256("2020-05-18 cement") = cadf84c9706ff4866f8af17d3c0e3503da44aea21c2580bd6452f7a1b8b48ed2

Then I use the gpg software to encrypt my files using the passphrase.key file:

    $ gpg --symmetric --passphrase-file passphrase.key --batch plaintext.txt

I then delete all the unencrypted files and the key files and just leave the
encrypted files behind.

XXX don't forget to delete this file, the key and the script before crossing borders
