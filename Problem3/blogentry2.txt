Blog entry #2

I know you all want to learn about my hobbies and interests!

Due to the sensitive nature of my affiliation with the "Plan X" group I'm not just writing this stuff out here for all the creeps to see it.

Fortunately, a valued customer with a cool black hat recently gave me a secure interface for storing sensitive information. He said that it's even open source (github:chatziko/pico) and ultra secure.

The secure Plan X server is up: xtfbiszfeilgi672ted7hmuq5v7v3zbitdrzvveg2qvtz4ar5jndnxad.onion! I can finally sleep feeling safe... Please come by the store (when we open) and ask me for the password first.

socat + onions = perfect recipe
